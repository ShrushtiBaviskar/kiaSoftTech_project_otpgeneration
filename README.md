# kiaSoftTech_project_otpgeneration
This project aims to generate alphanumeric One-Time Passwords (OTPs) using Python. The generated OTPs can be used for various purposes, such as authentication, verification, or password reset mechanisms.
An alphanumeric OTP consists of a combination of letters (both uppercase and lowercase) and digits, making it more secure compared to numeric-only OTPs. This Python project provides a simple OTP generation module that can be easily integrated into other applications.
